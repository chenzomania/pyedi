This is very easy to use programmer's editor written in Python. QScintilla is used as text edit component. This makes the editor customizable simply by editing it's source code (one Python script).

**pyedi** is not dedicated just for writing Python scripts. You can easily edit any text file. Even if you have some exotic file format, it is easy to define new syntax highlighting style and syntax check.

# Features #
  * very short start time,
  * one pure Python script,
  * multiple documents editing,
  * syntax highlighting (allows control of syntax styling),
  * folding,
  * autocompletion and call tips,
  * syntax checking.

# Requirements #
  * Python,
  * python-qt4,
  * python-qtext (need to build QScintilla from sources to get necessary latest version for Qt4),
  * python-kid (optional - for XML syntax check).
